# Social Network Hate Detection: Finding Social Media Posts Containing Hateful Information Using Ensemble Methods and Back-Translation
Recent research efforts have been directed to- ward the development of automated systems for detecting hateful content to assist social media providers in identifying and removing such con- tent before it can be viewed by the public. This paper introduces a unique ensemble approach that utilizes DeBERTa models, which benefits from pre-training on massive synthetic data and the integration of back-translation techniques during training and testing. Our findings re- veal that this approach delivers state-of-the- art results in hate-speech detection. The re- sults demonstrate that the combination of back- translation, ensemble, and test-time augmen- tation results in a considerable improvement across various metrics and models in both the Parler and GAB datasets. We show that our method reduces modelsâ€™ bias in an effective and meaningful way, and also reduces the RMSE from 0.838 to around 0.766 and increases R- squared from 0.520 to 0.599. The biggest im- provement was seen in small Deberate models, while for large models, there was either a minor improvement or no change.
